Elizabeth was also quick on her feet, thinking of ideas and options on the fly in response to my questions. We looked at sites together, compared options, and thought through some challenges. Partnership in action from the first moment. Thanks, Elizabeth! (Nonprofit pros: Don't miss a chance to work with her!)" Debra, IPPL</p>
